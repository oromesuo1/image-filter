A simple app that takes an image URL, filters it and returns the image. The app is hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk with the following end point: http://image-filter-dev222.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com When tested with a publicly available image url such as https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/2ecd3e90-2811-11eb-bf2e-a5ff0cfc4b94 on /filteredimage route with image_url as query parameter, it retrieves the image.
